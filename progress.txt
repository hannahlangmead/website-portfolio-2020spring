In this preview, I have a basic layout of my website. The title has a background photo that I styled to fit the page and be like a banner. I added tabs, which I am still figuring out how to format. Each tab has some content in it for an example. I started added photos into the gallery, but I need to figure out how to make it into a gallery format, or at least have the images centered so you can scroll down the page. I also added content to the Care Tips page which I still have to style. The quizzes page will just include links to fun quizzes which I still have to add. I plan on adding another tab for the home page, where I will include the short bios for each dog and a photo. I am nervous about adding so many images because they can really mess up the page if formatted wrong. Everything just takes me a long time to figure out. I think the way the tabs are formatted in html are really confusing and I might try to find a better way to do it, but right now I don’t have to use Java so it’s nice. I plan on adding some more background images like paw prints running through the back but I’m not sure if I’ll be able to execute it how I envision it in my head due to my very limited skills. I am going to focus on getting all of my content on the page and making the tabs work. After that is settled I can focus on decorating the page more and possibly doing the grid thing to make the layout more dynamic. I also want to find better font styles because I think the ones I have are boring. I also need to solidify a color palate. Overall, I am really happy with how the cover turned out so far.
