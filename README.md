Pitt Pups Website!

This is a website to show off mine, and my friends' cute dogs. It's a fun way to look at adorable pups and read about your friends' dogs when you miss then at college. That's it, simple!

All of my documents are in the 'docs' folder. 'index.html' is the home page and you can navigate from there.
