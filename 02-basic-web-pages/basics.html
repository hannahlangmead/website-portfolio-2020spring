    <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>

    <p>This is how you make an unordered list.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Add a "ul" element</li>
      <li>Add each item in it's own "li" element</li>
      <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Notice the new "ol" element is wrapping everything.</li>
      <li>But, the list item elements are the same.</li>
      <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Inline Element</h2>

    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a <strong>particular</strong> word or phrase.</p>
    <em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</em></strong>

    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>

    <p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be easier now.</p>
